* CSS and HTML Guidelines

This guideline will grow and evolve as Pixby does. If an idea here conflicts with your personal philosophy then we urge you to talk about it. The issues section is your soapbox, so do not be afraid to climb up and start yelling.

1. Only use classes/attribues/pseudoselectors. Make an attempt to refrain from the use of IDs and element names.
2. Don't use *. This isn't forward-thinking and creates a performance hit.
3. Try not to nest further than three levels. Any more is probably unnecessary and will add weight.
